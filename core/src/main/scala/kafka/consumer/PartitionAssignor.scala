/**
 * The fair assignor attempts to balance partitions across consumers such that each consumer threadÂ is assigned approximately
 * the same number of partitions, even if the consumer topic subscriptions are substantially different (if they are identical,
 * then the result will be equivalent to that of the roundrobin assignor). The running total of assignments per consumer
 * thread is tracked as the algorithm executes in order to accomplish this.
 *
 * The algorithm starts with the topic with the fewest consumer subscriptions, and assigns its partitions in roundrobin
 * fashion. In the event of a tie for least subscriptions, the topic with the highest partition count is assigned first, as
 * this generally creates a more balanced distribution. The final tiebreaker is the topic name.
 *
 * The partitions for subsequent topics are assigned to the subscribing consumer with the fewest number of assignments.
 * In the event of a tie for least assignments, the tiebreaker is the consumer id, so that the assignment pattern is fairly
 * similar to how the roundrobin assignor functions.
 *
 * For example, suppose there are two consumers C0 and C1, two topics t0 and t1, and each topic has 3 partitions,
 * resulting in partitions t0p0, t0p1, t0p2, t1p0, t1p1, and t1p2. If both C0 and C1 are consuming t0, but only C1 is
 * consuming t1 then the assignment will be:
 * C0 -> [t0p0, t0p1, t0p2]
 * C1 -> [t1p0, t1p1, t1p2]
